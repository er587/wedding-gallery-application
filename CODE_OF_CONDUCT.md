Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

1. **GitHub Issues** - For public, non-sensitive violations
2. **Private Contact** - For sensitive matters, contact project maintainers directly
3. **Email** - conduct@wedding-gallery.dev (if available)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** - Within 48 hours
2. **Investigation** - Gather facts and context
3. **Decision** - Determine appropriate response
4. **Action** - Implement consequences if necessary
5. **Follow-up** - Check on resolution effectiveness

### Consequences

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

#### Warning
Community members may receive a warning for minor violations or first offenses. The warning will explain why the behavior was inappropriate and what behavior is expected going forward.

#### Temporary Suspension
For more serious violations or repeated offenses, community members may be temporarily suspended from participating in the project. This includes being temporarily banned from:
- Commenting on issues and pull requests
- Submitting new issues or pull requests
- Participating in community discussions

#### Permanent Ban
For severe violations or continued disruptive behavior after warnings and temporary suspensions, community members may be permanently banned from the project.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been wrongfully accused or that the consequences are too severe, you may appeal by:

1. **Sending an email** to the project maintainers
2. **Providing context** and your perspective on the situation
3. **Explaining** why you believe the action was inappropriate
4. **Proposing** alternative resolutions

Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision.

- **Setting the tone** for community interactions
